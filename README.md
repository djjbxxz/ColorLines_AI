## Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms (PPO)
Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms is a policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning. The algorithm is based on the paper **[Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)**.

This repo is implemented based on Tensorflow framwork.

Trained over 300 hours on a single GTX 1080Ti.

The demo above is using the best model.

## Misc

Game environment code is written in C++ to boost up training process.

For game environment implementaion, please refer to **[this repo](https://github.com/djjbxxz/ColorLine_Environment/tree/tensorflow)**.
